Rails on Campus is a program started by Leon Du and Shaokun Wu, 2 ruby developers 
in Guangzhou, China. The idea is to build a good set of material for introduction 
courses that can be used to teach Rails on college campuses. College students are 
often not exposed to newer technology, and are left to learn on the job. The goal 
of this program is to introduce students to the world of open source development 
frameworks to help prepare them for a good job.
